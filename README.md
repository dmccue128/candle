LED Candle you can blow out

This is a CircuitPython program to monitor LED temperature (voltage) and switch off the LED when temperature drops (voltage increases) e.g., due to someone blowing on the LED.  

Based on the original "An LED You Can Blow Out Like a Candle!" by electron_plumber on Instructables.com at https://www.instructables.com/An-LED-You-Can-Blow-Out-Like-a-Candle/

The circuit includes a (very small SMD) LED, a reed switch that can be triggered by a nearby magnet to "re-light" the candle, and a tilt switch that can be used to switch the candle on or off without changing the temperature of the LED or triggering the reed switch.
